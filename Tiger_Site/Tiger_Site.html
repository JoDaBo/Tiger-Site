        <p style="color:white;">
            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species among the Felidae
            and classified in the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its 
            dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. 
            It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and 
            wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, 
            requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements 
            for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother 
            for about two years, before they become independent and leave their 
            mother's home range to establish their own.

        <h2 style="color:white;">More Info</h2>
        <p style="color:white;">
            The tiger's closest living relatives were previously thought to be the 
            Panthera species lion, leopard and jaguar. Results of genetic analysis 
            indicate that about 2.88 million years ago, the tiger and the snow leopard 
            lineages diverged from the other Panthera species, and that both may be more 
            closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar. The 
            geographic origin of the Panthera is most likely northern Central Asia. 
            The tigerâ€“snow leopard lineage dispersed in Southeast Asia during the Miocene.
